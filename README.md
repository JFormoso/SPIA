Pathway enrichment analysis with SPIA

Genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics technologies generate large amounts of data that must then be analyzed in the most efficient way possible. A growing trend is to analyze the genes obtained in functionally related groups. This is achieved by the **Pathway enrichment analysis**. The aim of this method is to identify groups of genes with possibly moderate but coordinated expression changes under different biological conditions. 

Here we are going to use a topological analysis called SPIA. This method takes into account the fold change of the genes, the score for the pathway enrichment and the topology of the signaling pathways to determine if a pathway is affected.
